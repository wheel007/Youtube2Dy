1
00:00:01,436  > 00:00:05,635
My advice to the young people

2
00:00:03,516  > 00:00:07,468
25 years old,

3
00:00:05,635  > 00:00:08,888
make enough mistakes,

4
00:00:07,468  > 00:00:10,380
don't worry

5
00:00:08,888  > 00:00:12,334
You fall

6
00:00:10,380  > 00:00:20,229
you stand up. You fall, you stand up

7
00:00:12,334  > 00:00:22,324
Enjoy it, I mean, 25 years old enjoy the show, enjoy the show.

8
00:00:20,229  > 00:00:24,307
From 30 to 40 years old,

9
00:00:22,324  > 00:00:27,625
you have to think very clearly

10
00:00:24,307  > 00:00:29,252
Were you working for yourself

11
00:00:27,625  > 00:00:32,593
if you really want to be entrepreneur.

12
00:00:29,252  > 00:00:36,521
So 40 to 50 think about,

13
00:00:32,593  > 00:00:39,631
how can you focus on things that you are good at

14
00:00:36,521  > 00:00:41,853
But when you are 50 to 60 years old

15
00:00:39,631  > 00:00:44,153
work for the young people

16
00:00:41,853  > 00:00:48,057
because young people can do better than you.

17
00:00:44,153  > 00:00:51,564
So rely on them, invest on them making sure they're good.

18
00:00:48,057  > 00:00:53,111
So 25 years old

19
00:00:51,564  > 00:00:59,887
Don't worry

20
00:00:53,111  > 00:01:02,752
Any mistake is an income, is a wonderful revenue for you.

21
00:00:59,887  > 00:01:05,680
In the future, it's not about the competition of knowledge.

22
00:01:02,752  > 00:01:07,664
It's the competition of creativity,

23
00:01:05,680  > 00:01:09,308
it's a competition of imagination,

24
00:01:07,664  > 00:01:12,060
it's a competition of learning,

25
00:01:09,308  > 00:01:14,923
it's a competition of independent thinking.

26
00:01:12,060  > 00:01:18,010
If you think like a machine the problem will come.

27
00:01:14,923  > 00:01:21,494
In the past 20 years, we make people like a machine

28
00:01:18,010  > 00:01:23,923
in the next 20 years, machines will look like people.

29
00:01:21,494  > 00:01:25,476
So in the future it's not knowledge driven,

30
00:01:23,923  > 00:01:27,025
it's the wisdom driven,

31
00:01:25,476  > 00:01:31,532
it's the experience driven.

32
00:01:27,025  > 00:01:34,618
In the past it's the knowledge driven and it's the manufacturing driven

33
00:01:31,532  > 00:01:38,292
and in the future it's the creativity driven.

34
00:01:34,618  > 00:01:42,537
I think next 30 years the world is going to change a lot.

35
00:01:38,292  > 00:01:47,011
The new technology is going to change every aspect of the world

36
00:01:42,537  > 00:01:50,924
So this is what we think the world should be focusing on

37
00:01:47,011  > 00:01:52,573
not only the IQ, EQ but also focus on LQ

38
00:01:50,924  > 00:01:55,978
the Q of Love.

39
00:01:52,573  > 00:01:59,192
Because only when you care for the others, only when you care for

40
00:01:55,978  > 00:02:00,834
the others that succeed and are more successful than you are

41
00:01:59,192  > 00:02:03,905
you have the chance.

42
00:02:00,834  > 00:02:06,435
10 years ago internet was so good

43
00:02:03,905  > 00:02:10,633
when nobody believed internet was so good.

44
00:02:06,435  > 00:02:15,625
Now internet is so tough because all the smart people go to internet.

45
00:02:10,633  > 00:02:17,085
So you should go to the off ground.

46
00:02:15,625  > 00:02:22,068
I fail for...

47
00:02:17,085  > 00:02:28,051
Funny things like I failed in a key primary school test for two times

48
00:02:22,068  > 00:02:32,972
and I failed like three times for the middle school, middle schools.

49
00:02:28,051  > 00:02:35,384
No I tried, there is an examination that young people if you want to go university

50
00:02:32,972  > 00:02:37,042
you have to take, take the examinations.

51
00:02:35,384  > 00:02:39,692
So I failed three times.

52
00:02:37,042  > 00:02:41,184
When I graduated from university,

53
00:02:39,692  > 00:02:43,763
and before I, you know,

54
00:02:41,184  > 00:02:46,913
for three years I tried and failed in the universities.

55
00:02:43,763  > 00:02:48,634
So I apply for jobs for 30 times,

56
00:02:46,913  > 00:02:51,483
got rejected.

57
00:02:48,634  > 00:02:54,214
I went for police, they say “No, you’re not good”

58
00:02:51,483  > 00:02:57,546
I went to even the KFC,

59
00:02:54,214  > 00:03:01,998
when KFC came to China, come to our city

60
00:02:57,546  > 00:03:06,155
- You applied? - 24 people went for the job

61
00:03:01,998  > 00:03:09,813
23 people were accepted, I was the only guy.

62
00:03:06,155  > 00:03:12,202
And we went for the police, 5 people, 4 of them accepted.

63
00:03:09,813  > 00:03:15,415
I was the only guy they're not receiving.

64
00:03:12,202  > 00:03:21,580
So to me, being turned down, rejected

65
00:03:15,415  > 00:03:24,771
Oh, by the way, I told you that I applied for Harvard for 10 times, rejected.

66
00:03:21,580  > 00:03:27,540
I learned so much about the Hollywood movies

67
00:03:24,771  > 00:03:29,230
especially the- Forrest Gump

68
00:03:27,540  > 00:03:31,389
- You love Forrest Gump? - I love Forrest Gump.

69
00:03:29,230  > 00:03:33,642
Why do you like him?

70
00:03:31,389  > 00:03:35,443
Simple.

71
00:03:33,642  > 00:03:38,244
Never give up.

72
00:03:35,443  > 00:03:40,974
People- people thinking he's dumb

73
00:03:38,244  > 00:03:43,552
but he knows what he's doing.

74
00:03:40,974  > 00:03:46,789
And I was very depressed

75
00:03:43,552  > 00:03:48,313
the day... the year 2002 or 2003

76
00:03:46,789  > 00:03:52,653
in the States

77
00:03:48,313  > 00:03:55,842
I was very depressed when I could not find out a way for the internet

78
00:03:52,653  > 00:03:59,207
and then I watch the movie in my friend's home Forrest Gump

79
00:03:55,842  > 00:04:01,253
when I see him I think, "This the guy

80
00:03:59,207  > 00:04:02,714
we should learn from."

81
00:04:01,253  > 00:04:05,603
Believe in what you're doing.

82
00:04:02,714  > 00:04:09,023
Love it whether people like it or don't like it, be simple.

83
00:04:05,603  > 00:04:11,245
And like the words, "Life is like a box of chocolates"

84
00:04:09,023  > 00:04:14,713
you never know what you can get, right?

85
00:04:11,245  > 00:04:16,030
I never knew I would be here talking to you,

86
00:04:14,713  > 00:04:17,450
I never know.

87
00:04:16,030  > 00:04:19,593
But today I made it.

88
00:04:17,450  > 00:04:22,362
I told my people in my apartment

89
00:04:19,593  > 00:04:24,624
18, 15 years ago

90
00:04:22,362  > 00:04:28,131
"Guys we have to work hard

91
00:04:24,624  > 00:04:31,552
not for ourselves, if we can be successful

92
00:04:28,131  > 00:04:33,313
80% of the young people in China can be successful.

93
00:04:31,552  > 00:04:36,867
We don't have a rich father,

94
00:04:33,313  > 00:04:38,811
a powerful uncle, we don't get one dollar from bank,

95
00:04:36,867  > 00:04:42,359
one cent from government.

96
00:04:38,811  > 00:04:46,486
Just work as a team.

97
00:04:42,359  > 00:04:49,705
I worry about it today, young people, a lot of young people lose hope,

98
00:04:46,486  > 00:04:53,300
lose vision and start to complain.

99
00:04:49,705  > 00:04:57,204
We also have the same problem, when I got...

100
00:04:53,300  > 00:04:59,123
It's not a good feeling being rejected by so many people

101
00:04:57,204  > 00:05:02,272
We also depressed

102
00:04:59,123  > 00:05:05,185
but at least later we find...

103
00:05:02,272  > 00:05:06,899
that the world has a lot of opportunities.

104
00:05:05,185  > 00:05:08,978
How you see the world?

105
00:05:06,899  > 00:05:15,478
How you catch the opportunity?

106
00:05:08,978  > 00:05:18,286
So... and Hollywood gives me a lot of inspiration.

107
00:05:15,478  > 00:05:20,945
I, at the beginning I never thought...

108
00:05:18,286  > 00:05:22,326
I thought when I was young I said,

109
00:05:20,945  > 00:05:25,667
"Everything is possible".

110
00:05:22,326  > 00:05:28,420
Now I know not everything is possible.

111
00:05:25,667  > 00:05:31,745
When you have something you have to think about

112
00:05:28,420  > 00:05:33,379
you have to consider about the others, you have to consider about the customer,

113
00:05:31,745  > 00:05:37,814
society,

114
00:05:33,379  > 00:05:39,989
your employees, the shareholders.

115
00:05:37,814  > 00:05:44,115
There are so many things that

116
00:05:39,989  > 00:05:45,806
I think if you continue to work hard there's...

117
00:05:44,115  > 00:05:48,560
there's possibility.

118
00:05:45,806  > 00:05:49,941
It's not... if you don't do it

119
00:05:48,560  > 00:05:55,504
nothing is possible.

120
00:05:49,941  > 00:05:59,535
If you try to do it at least you have the hope.

121
00:05:55,504  > 00:06:01,811
Calm down, there's always a way out.

122
00:05:59,535  > 00:06:03,946
And keep yourself balanced.

123
00:06:01,811  > 00:06:07,628
And meanwhile, don't try to...

124
00:06:03,946  > 00:06:11,612
because business is a compt... Competition is fun.

125
00:06:07,628  > 00:06:14,746
Business is not a battlefield, you die or I win

126
00:06:11,612  > 00:06:19,855
Business... even if you die I may not win

127
00:06:14,746  > 00:06:21,570
right? So it's about, it's about fun.

128
00:06:19,855  > 00:06:23,696
- Yeah, - Tell them the story,

129
00:06:21,570  > 00:06:28,568
and tell them that if Jack...

130
00:06:23,696  > 00:06:31,457
I don't think in this world a lot of people be rejected more than 30 times

131
00:06:28,568  > 00:06:33,568
If we, you know, the only thing we never give up,

132
00:06:31,457  > 00:06:36,393
the only thing like, we’re like Forrest Gump.

133
00:06:33,568  > 00:06:39,543
We keep on fighting, we keep on changing ourself.

134
00:06:36,393  > 00:06:43,313
We don’t complain. Whether you are successful or not successful.

135
00:06:39,543  > 00:06:45,843
I find that when people, when they finish the job,

136
00:06:43,313  > 00:06:49,389
if they make a mistake and they fail,

137
00:06:45,843  > 00:06:51,413
if they always complained to others,

138
00:06:49,389  > 00:06:54,571
this guy will never come back.

139
00:06:51,413  > 00:06:57,492
If the guy only check himself,

140
00:06:54,571  > 00:07:00,475
Yeah. Something wrong with me here, something wrong with me there.

141
00:06:57,492  > 00:07:03,554
This guy has hope.

142
00:07:00,475  > 00:07:07,743
So many people I talked to at that time for AliPay, they say

143
00:07:03,554  > 00:07:12,060
"this is the stupidest idea you have ever got."

144
00:07:07,743  > 00:07:15,782
But I say, "I don't care if it's stupid or clever as long as people use it"

145
00:07:12,060  > 00:07:20,510
Now we have 800 million people

146
00:07:15,782  > 00:07:24,533
using this AliPay.

147
00:07:20,510  > 00:07:26,628
1999, year 2000 and even at the Yahoo time

148
00:07:24,533  > 00:07:29,327
a lot of people say, "This Jack is crazy.

149
00:07:26,628  > 00:07:31,628
He's- he's doing something that we don't understand."

150
00:07:29,327  > 00:07:36,659
And a lot of venture capitals give you money

151
00:07:31,628  > 00:07:40,030
because there is such a American model already there.

152
00:07:36,659  > 00:07:42,267
But they say, Alibaba we don't see this kind of model, right?

153
00:07:40,030  > 00:07:47,219
- They say Jack's crazy - yeah this is crazy guy

154
00:07:42,267  > 00:07:49,592
I mean I remember my first time in Time magazine

155
00:07:47,219  > 00:07:51,171
they call me crazy Jack

156
00:07:49,592  > 00:07:56,813
and I, I think crazy is good

157
00:07:51,171  > 00:07:58,488
we are crazy but we're not stupid.

158
00:07:56,813  > 00:08:03,170
We know what we are doing

159
00:07:58,488  > 00:08:05,249
but if everybody agree with me, if everybody believed my- our idea is good

160
00:08:03,170  > 00:08:08,844
we have no chance.

161
00:08:05,249  > 00:08:12,128
So that's... the money we raised, we're very thankful.

162
00:08:08,844  > 00:08:17,342
So, when our investors make a lot of money,

163
00:08:12,128  > 00:08:20,905
I feel proud and honored.

164
00:08:17,342  > 00:08:24,286
Everybody is made unique and different

165
00:08:20,905  > 00:08:28,055
so you must have a unique and different way.

166
00:08:24,286  > 00:08:29,349
A lot of people today have a lot of complaints

167
00:08:28,055  > 00:08:31,334
say, "I don't have opportunity."

168
00:08:29,349  > 00:08:34,691
I complained a lot when I was young

169
00:08:31,334  > 00:08:42,174
And suddenly I realized complaining does not solve any problem

170
00:08:34,691  > 00:08:47,546
where the opportunity always in the place where people complain

171
00:08:42,174  > 00:08:50,467
there are so many, if there are so many opportunities in the world in this world

172
00:08:47,546  > 00:08:54,656
because there are so many complaints.

173
00:08:50,467  > 00:08:56,685
If you can solve the complaint, one of the complaints

174
00:08:54,656  > 00:08:59,145
that’s the opportunity

175
00:08:56,685  > 00:09:02,978
so this is what we- we made

176
00:08:59,145  > 00:09:06,849
I think young people if my advice is to be an entrepreneur

177
00:09:02,978  > 00:09:10,285
don't be scared of failure, of setbacks

178
00:09:06,849  > 00:09:12,309
and don't give up.

179
00:09:10,285  > 00:09:15,118
When we start the business,

180
00:09:12,309  > 00:09:18,538
we had 18 founders including me

181
00:09:15,118  > 00:09:20,315
17 of them, most of them my students

182
00:09:18,538  > 00:09:25,711
and most of them...

183
00:09:20,315  > 00:09:27,917
Well, today people think, these 18 people, the smartest people in China

184
00:09:25,711  > 00:09:29,617
We don't think we were smart.

185
00:09:27,917  > 00:09:35,265
Honestly,

186
00:09:29,617  > 00:09:37,090
we all graduate from the very poor schools.

187
00:09:35,265  > 00:09:40,304
The only thing we did

188
00:09:37,090  > 00:09:42,455
we were very united, we all believed in the future,

189
00:09:40,304  > 00:09:44,479
we are all optimistic,

190
00:09:42,455  > 00:09:47,184
and we learn through mistakes,

191
00:09:44,479  > 00:09:52,001
we never give up.

192
00:09:47,184  > 00:09:53,778
If you graduate from famous university

193
00:09:52,001  > 00:09:58,451
please,

194
00:09:53,778  > 00:10:01,918
respect the people who graduate from the poor schools.

195
00:09:58,451  > 00:10:04,036
Those people like us graduate from poor universities

196
00:10:01,918  > 00:10:07,838
please respect yourself.

197
00:10:04,036  > 00:10:10,337
We have chance

198
00:10:07,838  > 00:10:12,337
we came today to...now

199
00:10:10,337  > 00:10:14,646
We made so many mistakes

200
00:10:12,337  > 00:10:18,549
people say, "You are lucky" Yes, we are very lucky.

201
00:10:14,646  > 00:10:22,621
We took only 19 years to today's size

202
00:10:18,549  > 00:10:24,850
But we have gone through so many tough situations.

203
00:10:22,621  > 00:10:26,794
We made so many mistakes

204
00:10:24,850  > 00:10:31,704
that people cannot even imagine.

205
00:10:26,794  > 00:10:30,952
In probably 19 years, you have gone through so many tough experiences

206
00:10:31,704  > 00:10:34,156
and that will make you different.
